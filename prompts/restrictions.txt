restrictions you need to implement:

- 1 full diagnostic test panel needs to be done for the member every three
months to check their progress on different biomarkers.
- Assume the member also does some research or reads about health or gets
curious questions about certain topics. So, there should be up to 5
conversations started by the member per week on average.
- The member is committing 5 hours per week on average to follow the plan.
- Assume exercises are being updated every 2 weeks based on the client's
progress.
- The member travels for at least 1 week out of every 4 weeks on business
trips.
- The membersâ€™ primary place of residence is Singapore.
- If you are generating report communication, assume you can just have text
messages highlighting either the areas which have problems or tracking of
something which the member or team cares about.
- When Elyx proposes a plan, the member sticks to it properly ~50% of the
time. That means ~50% of the time, the plan needs to be changed or
improved based on the members preferences / logistics constraints.
- Remember, the member is generally not sick, BUT *they can have 1 chronic
condition that they are managing (eg. high sugar, high BP)*
